Feature: EOF object
  Scenario: Check if a value is an eof object
    Given a file named "main.scm" with:
    """scheme
    (import (scheme base))

    (write-u8 (if (eof-object? (eof-object)) 65 66))
    """
    When I successfully run `scheme main.scm`
    Then the stdout should contain exactly "A"
