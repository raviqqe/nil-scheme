Feature: Bytevector
  Scenario: Write a bytevector
    Given a file named "main.scm" with:
    """scheme
    (import (scheme base))

    (write-bytevector #u8(65 66 67))
    """
    When I successfully run `scheme main.scm`
    Then the stdout should contain exactly "ABC"

  Scenario Outline: Get a length of a bytevector
    Given a file named "main.scm" with:
    """scheme
    (import (scheme base))

    (write-u8 (if (= (bytevector-length <value>) <length>) 65 66))
    """
    When I successfully run `scheme main.scm`
    Then the stdout should contain exactly "A"

    Examples:
      | value      | length |
      | #u8()      | 0      |
      | #u8(0)     | 1      |
      | #u8(0 0)   | 2      |
      | #u8(0 0 0) | 3      |
